The Swiss Army Knife of Android malware scanning, threat hunting, and cyber threat intelligence.

I am combining ClamAV's scanning engine and definitions with features like YARA and Sigma scanning, Quarantine, and API integration for static and dynamic analysis of malware samples.

Right now I plan to add a menu that takes API keys for services like VirusTotal, HybridAnalysis, MetaDefender, and more to come as I think of them.

There will be a UI for YARA and Sigma rule creation, editing with syntax checking, compressed ruleset import and export, API integration for automatic updates of rules databases.

More to come as it comes to me!

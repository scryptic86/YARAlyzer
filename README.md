The Swiss Army Knife of Android malware scanning, threat hunting, and cyber threat intelligence.

I am combining ClamAV's scanning engine and definitions with features like YARA and Sigma scanning, Quarantine, and API integration for static and dynamic analysis of malware samples.

Right now I plan to add a menu that takes API keys for services like VirusTotal, HybridAnalysis, MetaDefender, and more to come as I think of them.

There will be a UI for YARA and Sigma rule creation, editing with syntax checking, compressed ruleset import and export, API integration for automatic updates of rules databases.

Here's a general guide I generated with DeepSeek to help get me started.
